## Voice to Voice AI Bot

**Description:**
This code allows you to create a voice assistance system.

**Instructions:**

1. Download the zip file and unzip it.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install all the modules required for this project.
3. Go to [https://developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/setup](https://developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/setup) and create an API key. Please note that this key is private, so do not share it with others.
4. In `main.py`, search for the line `palm.configure(api_key="Add your Key")` and replace `"Add your Key"` with your API key.
5. Run the main file.

**Future Goal:**

My goal is to create an AI Call Service with a previous memory storage system.
